FOMObot for HipChat
===================

A HipChat bot that monitors rooms for message activity spikes. When activity spikes within a channel, FOMObot posts a message to the FOMO room to let anyone in that channel know that they could be missing out on an important conversation.

Based on [FOMObot for Slack](https://github.com/thoughtbot/FOMObot).
